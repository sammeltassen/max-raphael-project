This website commemorates the work of the German art historian and philosopher Max Raphael (1889-1952). Maintained by a small group of editors, the Max Raphael Project aims to open up Max Raphael's writings to an English-speaking audience for purposes of research and education. The presented texts are subject to change and new material is constantly being added. Please feel free to contact one of the editors in case you find any errors or would like to contribute to the development of the website.

- Links in the [Bibliography][4] to the digital edition of _Der Cicerone_, in which two articles of Raphael appeared in 1923 ([Über Gustav Wolff][5]) and 1924 ([Über Johann von Tscharner][6]).

- A previously unpublished essay by Patrick Healy titled ‘[Raphaels erste Epoche][7]’, originally presented at the 1989 Max Raphael conference in Hamburg, has been added to the resources section. It serves as an introduction to Raphael’s [autobiography][8] and early writings.

### 06-07-2018

Added [archival sources][9] and [secondary sources][10] to the bibliography.

### 02-07-2018

Thanks to Mr Werner Drewes, the following publication has been added to the [bibliography][11]:

> _Prähistorische Höhlenmalerei, Aufsätze, Briefe_ (Köln/Saignelégier: Bruckner & Thünker Verlag, 1993). Edited by Werner E. Drewes.

The book contains the original German typescript of _Prehistoric Cave Paintings_ together with a selection of letters of Raphael from 1943-52 concerning the genesis of the work and addressed to Claude Schaefer, Emmy Jülich and Alis Guggenheim. It also includes an essay by Mr Drewes titled ‘Raphaels Hand-Annäherungen’.

### 25-06-2018

Mr Yves Brocard kindly pointed us to a digitised address book of Pablo Picasso containing Max Raphael’s 1911/12 address in Paris: 11 Place du Panthéon. The address book can be consulted online here:

> [_Carnet d'adresses de Pablo Picasso_][12]

(There’s some discussion about the exact number: the entry from the notebook could also be read as 17. However, a 1912 open letter by Raphael (written under the pseudonym M.R. Schönlank) titled [_Lieber Herr Pechstein!_][13] is headed with the address ‘Paris, Place du Panthéon 11’.)

### 27-05-2018

Added Patrick Healy's essay [*Cézanne in the critical work of Max Raphael*][14].

### 18-05-2018
