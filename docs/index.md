### Conference: Marxism(s) in Art Historiography

The following conference was brought to our attention: [Marxism(s) in Art Historiography](https://arthist.net/archive/20793), Berlin, 31 Jan - 2 Feb 2020. The proposed period is 1945-today, which means that contributions on Max Raphael could focus on the reception of his work in the postwar period.

### Max Raphael’s Parisian address

Mr Yves Brocard kindly pointed us to a digitised address book of Pablo Picasso containing Max Raphael’s 1911/12 address in Paris: 11 Place du Panthéon. The address book can be consulted online here:

> [_Carnet d'adresses de Pablo Picasso_][12]

(There’s some discussion about the exact number: the entry from the notebook could also be read as 17. However, a 1912 open letter by Raphael (written under the pseudonym M.R. Schönlank) titled [_Lieber Herr Pechstein!_][13] is headed with the address ‘Paris, Place du Panthéon 11’.)
