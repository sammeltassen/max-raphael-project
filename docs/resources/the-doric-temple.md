## Foreword

{>>Summary<<}Three different myths are at work with regards to modern examinations of the ancient world. In each epoch, the following approaches succeed each other or are intertwined:

- Concerning content [inhaltlich]. Latest example: Romanticism (Burckhardt, Nietzsche, Bachofen).
- Formalistic. Latest example: Classicism (Winckelmann, Lessing, Goethe).
- Methodological. This one is least recognisable but most valuable: it penetrates ungreek matter with greek spirit.

Romanticism and classicism are deeply connected to bourgeois movements, either in a revolutionary or reactionary way. A new myth is now building with Le Corbusier, Strawinsky, Picasso, Valéry as proponents. Its nature cannot yet be overseen.

This book is a deliberate contribution to a new Greek renaissance, with the Paestum Poseidontempel at the center of the discussion. On the one hand in opposition to the classicist view, which could only get used to this ‘frightful’ architecture with the help of art history (Goethe's Italian journey), and to the romantic myth, which disregarded art in favour of an interest in religion and sociology. On the other hand, in recognition of architecture as universal art and of this temple’s (epistemological) realism in contrast to all the idealist phases of both Greek and modern history. But more importantly, the methodological approach itself aims to direct the new renaissance. It excludes any developmental history and is limited to an art science grounded in the theory of creation [schaffenstheoretisch]. Its first task is to document/capture the artistic object, and second to distill/derive/read off [ablesen] from the object its world view/philosophy. In absense of a science of art, the method is developed in the examination [Auseinandersetzung] of individual artworks. First the design is discussed, then the idea expressed in the work.

## A. Form
### I. The building [Baukörper]

Each building (Baukörper) has three main characteristics:
- Extension (Ausdehnung)
- Matter (Materie) 
- Energy (Energie)

Extension it shares with any geometrical body. Its shape (Figur) is a coherence of places, which divides the total space in enclosed (and designed) and excluded (and undesigned) space. The second characteristic is shared with all physical bodies. It doubles the aforementioned border (between in- and outside) and allows to distinguish between outer and inner form. The third is closely related to the second and is the play of forces, loads and supports, shearing force, buttresses, etc. The building is therefore the materially and energetically realised composition of places, which defines, as a boundary, the enclosed space and its connection it to the exterior. The design of the border will further determine the connection or division between both spaces.

This definition is too indeterminate, as it would fit any object (Körper), including a plastic one. Only the study of its concretization and relationships, provides the right nuances to understand Doric buildings as an architectural, and, as often falsely assumed, plastic object.

#### 1. Geometric figure

##### a)

The Doric Tempel is a unified building: the compositional fusion of two different shapes. A [Parallelepiped] (Parallelepipedon, of planes and right angles, cuboid) and a prism (of planes and not right angles) are fused into a shape which Front exists of 5 sides, and the total volume of 7 planes. The first is the (quantitive) foundation, the other the (spiritual) crown. The fusion is achieved by (1) the diagonals, which across the stepped corners  reach into the Pteron (peristyle) and further into  the Antenfront (fn) (this compositional preparation of the pediment is clearly visible at the Poseidontempel, while lacking at others), the (2) inward upward movement (the stepped corners, the tapering and slanting of the columns and beams) and (3) by the ridge (ipv hoekkeper) connecting both pediments, parallel to the depth axis.
A comparison with the simpler volumes of the Egyptian pyramid, and assembled volumes of the Christian church provides a better understanding of the Doric Temple as a unity dissected into / composed of two opposite parts. In the pyramid, four coherent and unarticulated planes lean toward each other until they converge in four borders and a point. Each of the slanting surfaces becomes a Isosceles triangle. Even greater is the geometric simplicity of the Colosseum, where the oval shape determines the articulation of the upper floors, but is not replaced by another shape. In contrast, the romanesque church is assembled of multiples cuboids stretching in all three directions. Here the assembled geometry is based on a transcendental and religious view; the shape of the cross.

##### b)

The opposite elements, fused into a unifying figure, were proportionally linked according to the Greeks. 12 temples of greater Greece fall into 2 geometric categories. These 12 temples were all visited and measured by Raphael; others were studied by means of photos and reconstructions. The measurements served just as an aid to understand the artworks, not an end in itself. Better measurements are possible. The current bad state of the monuments corrupts the measurements. The measurements were compared to those of others, which led to the conclusion that the  superficial measurements of Koldewey and Puchstein do not justify the dogmatic approach of their successors. (Table comparing the depth and width of the Stylobat of 12 temples to the height of the columns, fn 4a.) The geometric limitations match those of Greek tragedy and the few principles of Presocratic philosophy. For the group of larger temples, the Stylobat measures $200 * 80$ Greek foot, and the height of the columns is 30 foot. For the smaller temples, these measurements are 115, 45 and 15. The Greek foot measures either 0.296 (eg at the Poseidontempel) or 0.350 (eg at the Juno and Concordia tempel in Akragas). All deviations can be explained on  the basis of the individuality of the artistic conception, which materialized in the building. 
Organized by size, the dimensions are ordered as follows: depth, width, height. The earthly dimension of events and their equality, which cannot even be escaped by a movement of the head, is the axis for the connection between the other dimensions. Often the ratio between the depth and the width of the Stylobat is close to the golden ratio, and relate to each other like the small part to the whole ($80:200 = 2:5$). And often the overall height (of the pediment) is the greater part of the subdivided smaller part (80 subdivided into 50 and 30; column height is 30). (The width is the small part of the depth, and the height of columns is the small part of the width. Pediment tip is 50.) The golden section plays an important part in the Doric Tempel both for the line segments and the angles, in the approximations:

$200 : 120 \approx 120 : 80 \approx 80 : 50 \approx 50 : 30$

5 : 3 ≈ 3 : 2 ≈ 8 : 5 ≈ 5 : 3

In the text: 2 : 3 = 3 : 5 and 3 : 5 and 5 : 8.

Its characteristics are: (1) it creates a relationship between unequal parts which also expresses their relationship to the whole structure, (2) it balances static and dynamic divisions. It therefore is an immanent, all-round, design-determining proportion.

##### c)

This is why the Doric building is finite and conceived for a finite eye. The entire architectural organism is contained between the depth-movement of the sides and the width-movement of the fronts. Between the ascending stairs and descending roof. The movement is closed within itself, not from the outside; becomes a Being. All it is can be seen, although not in its being but in its effect. The varying intercolumniation, the asymmetries between both fronts and sides, and within individual fronts and sides, are only visible with a measuring stick and not instantly/directly to the eyes. The entire artistic meaning depends on their indirect effect: the liveliness in repeating the same. The building in its finiteness is not just rational, but the irrational moment is organically encapsulated in its creation according to its substance (genesis eis ousian). 

> genesis eis ousian - Schöpfung gemaß der Substanz. ousia ist die erste der zehn aristotelischen Kategorien. Raphael hatte wahrscheinlich »Wesensschöpfung« übersetzt.

##### d) Constancy

The Doric Tempel is a constant building volume. It cannot be prolonged, widened or elevated without reconsidering the inherent laws between all dimensions in their totality. Within this constancy, and closely connected to it, one can locate an objective and subjective reality. The first consists of the probable ever increasing differentiation of the intercolumniation of the front and sides. Even after switching to contraction this was not completely abandoned. Still at Segesta, the centre intercolumniation of the temple’s front is not of the same size as the normal intercolumniation of the sides.[^5]

[^5]: {>>Summary<<}These assertions counter the measurements of Koldewey. Multiple centimeters in the case of Segesta. Criticises measurements of Puchstein and Koldewey. There’s a rhythmic contraction, not simply a metric one. P and K interpret the building to fit their hypothesis: everything else is an exception/deviation. Everything can be averaged with maths. The bays are miscalculated. The average is _not_ present in the actual temple. It is methodically impossible to speak of uniform dimension and inaccuracies. It’s not that there’s no average or norm, but these are underlying principles, the backbones for the development of the dimensions, not their concrete reality. Their realization is not based on technical inaccuracies but on the principle of free rhythm, which principle is varied at each interval with the aim to develop multiple solutions to the same challenge, to relate and interpenetrate row and symmetry.

Both fronts at Paestum are differentiated when looking at the intercolumniations following the contraction of the corner. Their purposefulness is proven by the fact that these differences are repeated on the inner fronts (connected to the cella). This is obvious in the remains at Propylon, Gaggera (Selinunt, Sicily). Subjective relativity is obtained from the point of view of the observer and limited to the contraction or stretching of the visibility of the individual columns or intercolumniation. Borders are drawn by the height of the line of sight, fluctuating within the height of the capitals; by the line of encountering (approach?), which coincides with either the centre axis of the front or the corner columns; by the symmetry of the fronts and the constancy of forms down to the last detail. When the Christian architect changes the capitals every other column, he relativizes the front through the diagonal view, and this again by the totally different choir view, thereby emphasising the relativism of the building by removing every chance of affirmation. The church is turned into a visible sign for something invisible. The being of the Doric building is sufficient in itself and for this complacency, the condition for possibility of beauty, the constancy of the whole and the parts is stressed. That does not alter the fact that the tempel will be seen from all four sides and will demonstrate for each side a corresponding expression of the view, within the same visual language.

##### e)

The Doric tempel is a subdivided building, according to form and number.

##### f)

There are three main sections, which are then further subdivided: the stylobate, with the steps, the colonnade with the beams, and the roof/pediment. The lower part normally has an odd number of steps, which almost never resemble a square or a cube. Each step is higher than an average male footstep, in other words not conceived for a lightly ascent.
The middle part is divided into the colonnade and the beams/entablature. The colonnade consists of fullness and emptiness, of object and air, of light and shadow, of projecting and recessed, of columns and intercolumniation. 
The column as a body - in contradiction to its conception as a play of forces - is a material stone body like a immaterial aerial body. The stone body is determined by:
- The ratio of its diameter and height, in which the number 5 is constant, but in which in the lower and middle diameters change/alternate.
- The height-width ratio of column and echinus
- The number of flutings and the ratio between their width and circumference of the column (often determined by square number), its own depth; because of the tapering which fluctuates between D/5 and D/10 (D = diameter).
- Whether or not entasis is used.

The duality of the articulation of column and intercolumniation, is not simply juxtaposed by the Greeks. Body and air enclose one another, interpenetrate the individual column (as in the complete building, as we shall see).
This is obvious when considering the following: the perpendiculars reaching down from the abacus form a pillar made of air, while those reaching down from the upper diameter cut a cilinder in the stone column. Between those lines lie the perpendiculars of the bottom diameter, which only touches the stone column in one place, and the middle diameter, which runs half in stone and half in open air. This interweaving of stone and open air figure corresponds to that of column and intercolumniation, as the aerial border of the column is positioned in the intercolumniation while the border of the stone column is the border of the intercolumniation.
The aerial body of the column can be measured by the column height without abacus, and the width (diameter?) of the upper echinus; the stone body by the height of the shaft and the middle diameter. Looking at the relationship between the two, 12 tempels of Greater Greece fall under 2 proportions: 2:3 and 3:4. Under a common denominator the proportions differ only a single numerator: 8:12 and 9:12. A variation which frequently returns.
The beams (± entablature) are split into two parts: the architrave and the frieze. The first puts together all previous parts in a single wall-like band. Although it is unarticulated, the eye knows of the structure, rhythm, which is dynamic silently sunk down into this band and whose secret nature is only indicated at its borders: by the gutta on top and at the bottom by the change of light and shadow. The architrave lays, in order to be supported; a weight held in in the air, high activity demanding passivity. In contrast, the steps, having a similar wall-like character, lay in order to support; high passivity demanding activity. This is the principle of reversal in creation.
The next building part, the geison with its flats and hanging gutta, is part of both the entablature as the pediment. Like in the capital of the column, the unified piece has a double function and the border is only drawn by discontinued profiles.
The pediment consists of three bordering profiled geisa and the indented wall.
The elements of the Doric temple are not numerous but nevertheless very differentiated. One could say: all forms are a variation of a principle. This principle is the division of the wall. It’s spatial shifting and curling up. In this way the steps, architrave, metopes, abacus, pediment and the wall itself are just local projection or indentations. The column is rolled up wall, structured according to an energetic viewpoint. The triglyphs reduced columns, unrolled to the wall plane, the gutta little columns, the echinus an upside down contracted column. The proof of the correctness of this view is the fact that the column circumference at least equals and often exceeds the width of an intercolumniation plus column diameter. (Footnote 6, table: no intercolumniation nor bay exceeds the column circumference.) Moreover the fact hat the distance between the core building and the columns is gradually decreased (in time?) until it equals or falls below the column circumference.

(Table footnote 7:) in the later Juno, Poseidon and Concordia temples, the east Pteron (largest distance between columns and cella) is less than the middle column circumference. The same for temple C, wrongly dated by Koldewey and Puchstein. In the case of the Basilica, Ceres, tempels A and E the pteron more or less equals the lower column circumference. Only the early temples D, F and the Herculestempel have a Pteron which is larger than the circumference. 

Back to text:
Lastly, the immaterial modelling plane cutting through the entire front and lining up the columns ‘invisible-visible’. 

This limitation of the diversity of forms allows for precision in proportions and a relationship between proportions and various building parts, which no other art achieved. Thus the developmental direction is to bring ever more parts to the 2:3 proportion, which was originally an angle-proportion in the ground plan construction. The ratio of middle diameter to intercolumniation, from abacus to a section of the architrave (between two abaci), between triglyph and metope, between the two directrices in the plan all gradually conform to this constraint. 
In the subdivision of the building certain numbers are preferred: 2 columns and 1 intercolumniation are followed by 2 metopes and 3 triglyphs; each triglyph has 2 whole and 2 half cuts and 3 elevations. Furthermore above 2 columns 5 slabs with drops (Mutules); above each intercolumniation 4 viae (spaces between mutules), so that the number are not only enlarged, but first preferring square numbers, then the numbers 2, 3, 5, from which easily the proportion 2:3 = 3:5 can be derived. This creates a relationship between the preferred proportion (2:3) and the number of building parts.
To these number belong by no means the bay, i.e. the bisection of two columns and the connection of their inner half across the intercolumniation, or in other words the direct connection of parts unrelated to the whole. This is an unhistoric projection (by an historicist era) of a concept of Roman or Christian architecture onto Greek architecture - with which it has nothing in common.

(Footnote 7a:) ‘Bay’ and column + intercolumniation both originate from the wall, but have developed differently out of it and have a different relationship to it. In the Christian church, the void grows out of an interruption of the otherwise intact wall and it remains secondary/subordinate to it as a tangible non-being. In contrary, the pillar is a projecting part of the wall and superordinate to it. At the Doric Temple, the void grows out of the subdivision and rotation of the wall. To the extent that column and intercolumniation become real (the void is the being of the non-being), they become independent and the original wall disappears into an imaginary modeling plane. The (Christian) bay grows out of a transcendent principle and the trinity of wall, pillar and void gives the bricked (aufgemauerte) architecture.
In brick architecture, the bay is characterized by a contrast between load-bearing and supported parts, between wall and pillar - a dualism completely at odds with Doric architecture. The load-bearing and supported forces are decomposable in principle. On the one side, because of this, the pillar is just a bundle of directional forces (Kraftstrahlen), whose formal coherence is only external. On the side side, the decomposition of the total force in partial forces determines the bay. 
The decomposition of the column goes against the Greek spirit, because its bodily form is the synthesis of opposites. The architect of the Doric temple admittedly knows multiple bearers, but the load is one and thereby chains together the separate bearers. The Greek has a unity of force and form, the Christian a dualism.
In the bay of the Christian church a total different relationship exists between the dimensions, and a different order in the total space. Here width is dominant, there depth. The single bay (in the Christian Church) is inferior to the depth-movement of the space as a whole, despite having an elaborate and diverse expression (Formensprache). Column and intercolumniation (in the Doric Temple) are not inferior to the total width of the front; its spatial function does not exceed its formal presence (formales Sein) – contrary to the discrepancy in the Christian Church. In the Church, the arcade supports are primarily lonely as individual; it’s procession – tied together by a transcendental force – is a arranged row, in which the dynamic principle of connecting one support to the next is infinite. The ancient row of columns, of which each member is social despite its individuality, is the juxtaposition of singularities in a primarily defined and finite cube.

(Back to text)
After the unity, the mean parts, the rhythm and law of the coherence of parts has been indicated, the method still needs to be outlined according to which the parts and whole are related. Contrary to the dividing (deductive) method, in which the part is determined by and dependent on the whole, and contrary to the additive method, in which the whole is composed of parts, there’s no immediate connection. Rather, because both part and whole depend on the same principle and the same laws of proportion, they indirectly and voluntarily form an harmonious whole. Within this general method of concordance, which no one later understood and applied as much as Leonardo da Vinci, there remains space for gradual variations, depending on whether the parts are fit within the whole without being dependent on it (Poseidontempel in Paestum); the parts relate to the whole while emphasising their juxtaposition (Concordiatempel); the parts are placed above the whole, without making the whole dependent on them (Partenon). If one combines what has been said about the relationship between part and whole with was has been said about the relationship between principle and formal reality (what will still be expanded), one could characterise this further with sentences from presocratic philosophy, which recur in different variations: Kai ek panton hen kai ex henos panta (Heraklit, Diels, Vorsokratiker 12 B 10).
The doric building is a strictly implemented geometrical construction consisting of little interrelated figures, which return in different configurations in all temples.

(Back to text:)
Because the construction of the plan also determined the composition of spaces (Raumgestaltung), only the construction of the front will be elaborated in the following. Presupposing that the Greek architect had indicated the element of construction in one of the strict geometrical figures (abacus and pediment), in contrast to the parts which have been relieved from the strictly geometrical, one can determine the following for the Poseidontempel (Fig. 1):
One takes (on the horizontal axis of a right-angles coordinate system) in symmetrical position the distance AB between the two outer lower edges of the two middle columns and constructs the so-called ‘Golden section triangle’ ABC, meaning an isosceles triangle (gelijkbenig), whose base angles measure 75 degrees and it top angle 30 degrees, its ratio therefore 5:2, close to the golden ratio. The top touches the middle axis around the upper border of the triglyph, the sides the lower corner of the abacus. The first step of the next construction gives us the three main points of the elevation. If one draws the perpendiculars of the triangle from the corners (hoogtelijnen), the 7th perpendicular determines the column shaft, the 9th the abacus (top), the 14th the height of the architrave. The number of these perpendiculars determining the elevation has a ratio of 7:2 (14:7) and 2:5 (??), which determine the plan ratio of the core building and the stylobate. That such relations cannot be found in the early temples (like D and C. in Selinunt) but are present in older ones (like Concordia in Akragas) proves that the development of the building proceeded in connection with, and dependent on the plan, i.e. that the building was a adequate expression of the spacial composition.

Now the starting points of the fixation of the irregular, free-rhythmic structuring of the plan have been set. If one constructs on the middle axis of the building at the height of the shaft and triglyph border (point D and C) for each point an equilateral (gelijkzijdig) and a right-angled triangle, whose angles can be divided by 15 degrees, one can determine the following base points on both sides of the central axis: the axis of the second intercolumniation (E), the outer border of the second column (F), the axis of the second column (G), the outer border of the corner column (H). Presuming equal strength of the columns, one can now determine the base points on the stylobat.
As a consequence of being able to construct the middle axis of the middle columns, the abacus width can be calculated, while the top width of the shaft is still missing. If one connects the middle axis of the building at the intersection of the abacus height (K) with the base points of the outer columns, a triangle is formed whose top angle is 105 degrees (dividable by 15 degrees) and has a ratio of 7:5 to the sum of the base angles (75 degrees), in other words relates to the plan proportion of the  Stereobates (3:7) and the core building (2:7). The sides of the ‘characterising triangle’ touch the inner corners of the upper shaft of the middle columns and determine the upper diameter, in other words its tapering.
For the structuring of the triglyphs, the right angle at L, at the intersection of the axes, can be divided in 15 degrees. The first ray touches the outer point of the second triglyph. The second ray the axis the axis of the second triglyph at its upper border and the third the outer corner of the upper diameter, i.e. the outer corner of the last triglyph.
In this way, all the points of the elevation have been found and the construction is complete – only the pediment is missing. Presumably this can be found by constructing an isosceles (gelijkbenig) triangle over the total width of the stylobat, whose base angle amounts to (180-75)/2 degrees so that the relationship between base and top angle is opposite to that of the ‘characterising triangle’. The perpendicular of the base angle of this ‘pediment triangle’ touches the upper fries so that now point A and B could also be found by a construction from the top of the middle axis.
Characteristic of this construction, opposed to the later ones composed with analogous elements in other temples (?), is first the repetition of the parallel auxiliary lines and right-angles triangles at two different heights, due to which the depth distances LE and LG on the one side, and F and LH on the other are proportionally related tot he heigh distances CD;
Secondly the fact that between the parallelconstruction of regular triangles (isosceles, right-angled) a irregular triangle simultaneously cuts the central axis not in the middle but in unequal parts (1:3 measured after the absolute size, 2:5 when considering the number of perpendiculars), thereby illustrating the lively play of forces in the building, the inequality of loads and supports. This disharmonic characteristic triangle pulls all the dramatic oppositions in its form together and refers over them to the resolution in the pediment.
Thirdly in the overal view of the construction. The triangles reaching downwards from the three points in the middle axis dominate over the upward reaching triangles from the base point. This resonates with the serious, heavy, tragic overal character of the building, the place of the part in the whole! The construction is a schematic but rational image of the optical experiential impression/perception.
##### g) (missing in WA)
Closely related to this geometric construction is the arithmetic relation, which has always been acknowledged but never depicted properly. Because science cannot get away with depicting the proportional relationships between individual parts, without graphically showing their relationship to the whole (three-dimensionally to be precise) and the variability of the relationships. Two examples to demonstrate the limitations of Koldeweys scheme.
The comparison shows that the by Puchstein asserted congruence of individual parts immediately gets another meaning when considering their relationship to the whole. At the Poseidontempel the proportion 2:3 is member of the golden section (2:3 = 3:5) while at the Concordiatempel each number is squared to move from the proportion which determines the details to those who determine the stylobat (depth).

##### h) (missing in WA)
The elements of every geometric or architectural body are mathematically either level/plane and straight, or surface and curve. There’s no doubt that the principle of plane and right angles is used, but that in the appearance regular surfaces, mostly cylinders at the column appear. This distinction between principle (Anfang, arché) and appearance (Gestalt, Erscheinung) has two important consequences. The intercolumniation have the tendency to take on an opposite movement tot the column. The original immaterial plane is dissected into concave and convex oppositions, which do not loose connection with the unity of the plane. We _see_ here what Plato has formulated as the fundamental problem of the dialectal method: How the singular and the many connect in a given number of parts (Gliedern).
The second consequence is that the imaginary plane only meet invisibly in the axes of the corner columns, while the eye perceives a curve. In this way the connection of geometrical elements is freed of the pressure of the sole geometrical sequence, in which the planes meet in straight lines and straight lines meet in points, line in the egyptian pyramid. The mathematical demand for a corner made place of a cylindrical body, and thereby freedom. The gap between arché and Gestalt and the freedom of being correlate closely, and both in connection to each other characterize the doric building. The recognition that the concave and convex has to be understood as the dissection of the principle of the plane in the formal reality, can also be explained from another viewpoint. In no other architecture there’s such a independent distinction _between_ the space that is inside and outside. While in Indian monolithic temples the border of the building volume led to the annihilation of the interior and the volume seems to be the architecture in its entirety, in the Christian church, esp in the gothic period, the border itself was close to being abolished, to demonstrate that, regardless how thin the shell is between inside and outside, she is principally infinite and between to essentially different spaces. At the Doric temple, the building, existing of colonnades, a kind of equilibrium between in- and outside. We will demonstrate how the air flows into the building in a certain rhythm, flows through it. And inversely, that the front is linked to the elevation and the historical development move towards transfer even more constructional elements of the plan to the elevantion, to create a close connection. \[this has already been shown]. Nevertheless for the optical impression the connection from the inside is loose, because the guidelines of the sidewalls fall in the axes of the second column (at the Poseidontempel) and from the outside the inviting banner is missing on the temples forehead (?): ‘come to me, all, who are laborious and loaded’ which adorns every portal of a christian church expresses; but the rejecting: know thouselves (erkenne Dich selbst). In this way, the independence is created of the colonnade between the inner decorated space and undecorated outside. It would be principally wrong to make this relative independence absolute when claiming that the Greeks were only concerned with the plastic formation of the peristyle, and just plastic not spatially, and that architectural imagination had operated there. 

Footnote 10 about the difference between plastic and architectural bodies. 5 pages. Architecture based on expression of forces, sculpture on human body.

Similar to the way in which the platonic Eros as daemon is the formal middle between the sensory-infinite and unity of the idea, between the mortal and immortal, taking part in both but still being a third, independent, in this way the Doric building is first and foremost the synthesis between the unformed outer space and the geometrically abstract plane as the ideal unity and principle of any spatiality; it is therefore formed space and despite its relative independence different from any plastic sculpture.
Summarizing... the building is the synthesis between the natural space and geometrical plane, i.e. its _finiteness_  is the synthesis between the infinite depth variety of natural space and depth dimension 0 of the abstract surface.;
Its _reality_ is the synthesis between empirical reality of natural space and the abstract-ratio reality of the plane: the reality of a concrete idea;
Its _structure_  a synthesis between lively accidental association of place and thing, and the abstract homogeneity of place and plane; i.e. it is necessary.
In the singular, unity is expressed as synthesis of simplicity and diversity.
The _ousía ek geneseos_ as synthesis between static and dynamic, the complete synthesis of ordered and unordered, etc. In other words: we concluded: unity as principle, dualism or better antagonism as method and form itself as result. So that in it, the one part (...) 

#### 2. Play of forces

Energies in architecture are different from other arts.
They have a primary, as it were activating (verursachenden), character. It’s impossible to think of them as independent. Where they are completed they appear in abstract and mechanical purity – contrary to sculpture, where they are completed when they have been freely formed out of human will and concretised in human-sensory gestures. Finally they intend a directly a relation with the cosmic and metaphysical forces – without any other means of expression than mathematics and physics (to the extend that these are a theory of forces).
Important for architecture are the selection, the ordening and the articulation of individual forces and they combinatory formes. I distinguish between (out of pure empirical grounds) the following kind of energies: the spatial-functional, the material-static and psychological-expressive. The material-static include the rotating, centrifugal, centripetal, normal, trust, slope (Neigung), and bending forces. The relation between forces are general-mechanically: action (Angriff), reaction (Ruckwirkung) (impost, Widerlager) and balance; optically: visible and invisible; materially: mass or ray (?) forces; aesthetically: touch, penetration/fusion/comprehension, resolution (free or bound), smoothing, breaking up.
a) In the doric building, the spatial-functional energies are expressed in the relationship between front and side, between steps and pediment and in the front itself.
α) The frequent change in the number of front and side columns would also express the importance of its ratio for the spatial composition, when it would not return in the regular width and depth proportion of the Stereobat. The energies of Front and Side pull on or push off. Because this relationship changes with the changing standpoint of the viewer, like with the height of the viewpoint, it is hard to draw general conclusions without repressing the diversity of the appearance and liveliness. Within these limitations, the following types can be discerned:
- The side escapes to the front, which escapes from the sides, etc, so that a quintessentially centrifugal type is created,  which prevents any fixed appearance (Gestalthaftigkeit) but also dramatic tension. An example is the Paestum basilika.
- Sides and front move to each other. In this centripetal type, the corner column of the encourter obtains a special character, it works like the abacus between column and beams. It is simultaneously the most dramatic and the form-fixed (Gestalthaft; vormvast? inflexible) type. And the properties are even strengthened because the energetic forces reverse secondarily, which becomes the primary value at some viewpoints. The Poseidontemple can be named as example.
- There are many steps in between these two extreme types. At the Segesta temple, for example, the long side moves in relative fast pace to the narrower front, which itself protrudes. Here not the meeting-column but the exit and final column emphasised as bodily mass, so that the movement between fixed columns is slowed down and is smoothed to a mild transition at the bend.

> Der jüngsten Mythos von Griechentum ‘zielt nicht auf etwas Festes ab, sei es die ideale Endgestalt, sei es das fundamentale Prinzip, sondern er ist ein Weg, der erstens die ganze Spanne zwischen Prinzip und Norm umfaßt, zweitens die Totalität und die Universalität der Inhalte, die auf diesem Wege gestaltet werden können. Er ist methodischer und speziell dialektischer Natur. Nicht als ob das Prinzip und die Norm von der Methode losgetrennt werden sollen, aber die schöpferische Aktivität, die auf dem Wege vom Prinzip zur Norm die Weltmaterie formt, hat den Akzent. Und insofern ist dieser neue Mythos vom Griechentum nicht nur eine systematische Einheit aller Kulturgebiete von der Wirtschaft bis zu Religion, sondern er hat auch einen organischen Zusammenhang mit den Kulturen aller Zeiten und Völker
